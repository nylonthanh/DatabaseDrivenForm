3 pass the data to the view
4 view tpl will have boilerplate html to  build a form
5 tpl will loop through data received frm the controller to build each form element


We would like you to create a database driven HTML form.  As this is a back-end position, the page's look and feel are not important, but the overall parameters are.

The look and feel of the overall site should be controlled by a constructor template.  The template parsing should be handled by Smarty or any other template system.  The template HTML itself can be stored in the database or file.

The form fields themselves and the order they're displayed on the page should be dynamically generated based on a MySQL stored set of parameters (eg, you need to devise a storage facility that will store the type of field to display, size, order to display, default value(s), whether they're required or not, etc)

The form must contain the following:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Address (street, city, state, zip/postal)
- Phone
- Fax
- A drop down list of "Best time to contact" giving them the option of Morning, Afternoon, Evening
- A checkbox for a faux Term of Services agreement

All fields except Fax should be required.

When the form is submitted, an email should be generated to the email address supplied - with the contents of the form contained within.

After the email is sent, display a confirmation page thanking the person for contacting us.

The code should be object oriented.  Perhaps a class to generate the pages, a class for the form fields  and a class to validate the form - however, do what you see fit to display your OO capabilities.

Once you are done,  can you please upload the code and the MySQL file to a github repository?
